# Conban: Console Kanban

Written in rust, for your productivity. 

Still very much a work in progress, and currently only supports a simple
 three column layout: Todo, In Progress, and Done.
 
 Currently, you'll need to install manually by cloning and setting it up how
  you like, but I plan to ship a script to auto install in the future.
